Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are set up to automate testing and deployment, ensuring new features and updates are rolled out smoothly and consistently. Version control is managed using Git, allowing for efficient collaboration among developers and a detailed history of code changes.

## Third-Party Integrations

EmoConnect integrates several third-party services to enhance its functionality. Google Maps API is incorporated to enable the interactive world map feature, allowing users to explore emotional stories by geographic region. Language Translation APIs, such as Google Translate, allow users to interact with content in multiple languages, making the platform more inclusive.
