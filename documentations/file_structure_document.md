# File Structure Document for EmoConnect

## Introduction

A well-organized file structure is essential for the development and maintenance of any software project. It ensures that team members can efficiently collaborate, manage code, and implement changes with minimal confusion. For the EmoConnect project, creating a clear file structure will support the platform's mission of fostering cross-cultural understanding through emotional storytelling. This document outlines the file organization based on EmoConnect's chosen tech stack, ensuring a seamless development process.

## Overview of the Tech Stack

EmoConnect is built using Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and a selection of UI tools including shadcn/UI and Radix UI for component styling, paired with Lucide Icons for visual elements. The backend is supported by Supabase, which manages the database, authentication, and storage needs. This tech stack influences the file structure by delineating frontend and backend directories and organizing environment and config files to facilitate smooth interaction between services.

## Root Directory Structure

At the root level, the EmoConnect project contains several key directories and files that lay the foundation for the application:

*   **/src**: Contains all source code for the project, split into frontend and backend subdirectories.

    *   **/frontend**: Houses Next.js components, TypeScript files, and styling using Tailwind CSS.
    *   **/backend**: Includes Supabase configurations and server functions.

*   **/public**: Stores static assets such as images, logo files, and favicon.

*   **/config**: Contains configuration files required for initializing the app environment.

*   **/docs**: Dedicated to project documentation, guidelines, and references.

*   **/tests**: Contains testing files and scripts to ensure code quality and reliability.

*   **package.json**: Manages project dependencies and scripts.

*   **README.md**: Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and documentation links.

## Configuration and Environment Files

The configuration and environment files are crucial for setup and deployment. They ensure that different environments (development, testing, production) operate seamlessly:

*   **.env.local**: Stores environment variables like API keys and sensitive information.
*   **supabaseConfig.js**: Configures Supabase with necessary database and authentication settings.
*   **next.config.js**: Customizes Next.js behavior and plugins based on environment needs.
*   **tailwind.config.js**: Defines Tailwind CSS settings to achieve the desired design system.

These files enable easy management of settings across various stages of application deployment and development.

## Documentation Structure

Documentation is structured within the **/docs** directory, providing comprehensive guides and references for developers:

*   **/setup.md**: Details initial project setup and local development guidelines.
*   **/architecture.md**: Explains the overall architecture and component interaction.
*   **/contributing.md**: Lists best practices and guidelines for contributing to the codebase.
*   **changelog.md**: Records project updates, enhancements, and fixes over time.

This organized structure ensures that team members have access to essential information for quality assurance and continuous improvement.

## Conclusion and Overall Summary

The EmoConnect file structure is pivotal in supporting development workflows and fostering effective collaboration among team members. By meticulously organizing directories and files in alignment with the project's tech stack, EmoConnect is set up for streamlined development and future scalability. With a focus on clear documentation and modular code organization, this structure not only aids current development efforts but also lays a robust foundation for ongoing enhancements and maintenance.
