The cursor should be a soft, glowing orb with an organic, fluid movement, creating a subtle trailing effect as it moves‚Äîrepresenting the flow of emotions across cultures. When hovering over a story card, the cursor should morph slightly in size, producing a delicate pulsating animation, signifying emotional resonance.
