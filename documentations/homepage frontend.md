Example: “Cultural Exchange of Emotions and Feelings: A Universal Connection” is presented in a bold, structured serif font for heritage and classic elegance.

To implement a custom cursor experience, ensuring it reflects the theme of emotional storytelling and cultural immersion, here is the detailed prompt: 
"Design a custom cursor that changes dynamically based on the user’s navigation across the Cultural Exchange grid. The cursor should be a soft, glowing orb with an organic, fluid movement, creating a subtle trailing effect as it moves—representing the flow of emotions across cultures. When hovering over a story card, the cursor should morph slightly in size, producing a delicate pulsating animation, signifying emotional resonance. Colors should shift subtly between warm gold (for nostalgia), deep blue (for introspection), and gentle green (for cultural connection), enhancing the emotional storytelling journey."
