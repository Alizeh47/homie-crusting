# Project Requirements Document (PRD): EmoConnect

## 1. Project Overview

**EmoConnect** is a web-based platform designed to encourage cultural exchange by exploring and sharing emotional expressions across different cultures. The primary goal is to foster cross-cultural understanding and provide users with meaningful insights into how various cultures experience and communicate emotions. The platform is targeted at global users, such as travelers, language learners, educators, and individuals passionate about emotional and cultural diversity.

The project is being built to bridge gaps in cultural understanding and to harness the universal nature of emotions in connecting people from diverse backgrounds. The key objectives include promoting authentic storytelling, encouraging interactive learning, and building a community where users can discuss and explore cultural differences and commonalities in emotional expression. Success will be measured by the level of user engagement, the quality and diversity of user-generated content, and the reach of global participation.

## 3. User Flow

A typical user journey on EmoConnect starts when a user lands on the homepage, welcomed by a floating header that provides navigation to essential sections. The hero section invites exploration with emotionally resonant visuals and call-to-action buttons. Users can dive into curated content blocks, such as "Emotions Around the World" and "Destinations for Every Emotion," where they find interactive elements like a clickable world map or emotion-themed destination cards.

Upon selecting a feature, users are directed to dedicated cultural pages where they can explore detailed information about travel destinations, cultural facts, foods, and language diversity. These sections may include highlights, personal stories, and user testimonials. Throughout the site, users can interact through forums and community threads, comment on stories, and contribute personal experiences, enhancing engagement and participation.
